    "\n",
    "### 1a. Get address latitude and longitude\n",
    "\n",
    "The geocoding API used in the tutorial also returns the latitude and\n",
    "longitude for an address:\n",
    "[nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/#json-with-address-details](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/#json-with-address-details)\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the code from the tutorial to add the latitude and longitude to\n",
    "the dictionary returned by `get_address_details`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. Reverse geo-coding\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a reverse geo-coding API that can be used to look up the\n",
    "address for a given latitude and longitude:\n",
    "[nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Reverse](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Reverse/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The AirBnB listings DataFrame you have used in previous lessons provides\n",
    "the latitude and longitude for each listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use the reverse geo-coding API to fetch address data for\n",
    "a small number of listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To avoid hitting rate limits, work with a small sample of listings,\n",
    "    e.g.: `listings_df = listings_df.sample(n=5)`\n",
    "-   Hint: Use the `.apply()` DataFrame method from [PyNoon Data Lesson\n",
    "    4](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pynoon/curriculum/blob/main/lesson_data_4/lesson_data_4_tutorial.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1c. Try another API\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a go using a completely different API, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A weather API: https://open-meteo.com/\n",
    "-   The Google Books API: https://developers.google.com/books\n",
    "-   Auckland Transportâ€™s API: https://dev-portal.at.govt.nz/\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Some APIs may require you to register for an API key that must\n",
    "> be provided with each request.\n",

    "## 2. Futurecoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the final lesson on [futurecoder.io](https://futurecoder.io):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Tic Tac Toe project\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can check which lesson you are up to on Futurecoder from the\n",

    "\n",
    "Use the `listings_df` dataset from the tutorial to answer the following\n",
    "questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should create a notebook that answers these questions one by one and\n",
    "uses Markdown/Text cells to explain how you arrived at the answer - as\n",
    "if you were reporting these results to a colleague.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Which parent region has the highest average listing price?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use a `groupby()` with an appropriate average statistic like\n",
    "`mean()` or `median()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: The answer changes depending on whether you use `mean()` or\n",
    "`median()`, what does that indicate?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. Create a bar chart to show how many listings of each room type there are in each parent region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use a `groupby()` with the `count()` statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1c. Do “home” listings cost more? Are they better reviewed? Do they accommodate more people?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use `.str.lower()` and `.str.contains()` to find listings with the\n",
    "keyword “home”, then use appropriate `groupby()`s and/or plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1d. Of hosts with at least 10 reviewed listings, who has the highest average rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use a `groupby('host_name')` on `review_scores_rating` with\n",
    "`.agg(['count', 'mean'])` to get both the count and mean of the ratings\n",
    "(see:\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.agg.html).\n",
    "Then filter hosts based on the count of listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1e. Which parent region has the most listings that have no rating? Which has the highest proportion of listings with no rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use `.isna()` to filter to listings with a missing rating. Then\n",
    "use `groupby()` or `value_counts()` to count the number of listings for\n",
    "each parent region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1f. Do listings with higher prices typically have higher ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use `cut()`\n",
    "(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.cut.html) to create\n",
    "a categorical column containing small number of price bands. Then use\n",
    "use appropriate `groupby()`s and/or plotting.\n",

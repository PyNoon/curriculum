   [pynoon.github.io](https://pynoon.github.io))
2. Click the "New Notebook" button (it may take a few seconds)

   cell (the first cell in a notebook will take a few seconds)

#### Continue Week 1's Exercise

* Show your calculation from Week 1's Exercise to a neighbour you didn't come with:
  * Without explaining your code, can they understand what each line
    achieves?
  * What changes would make it easier to read?
  * Hint: Add comments to explain your calculation
    * Lines starting with `#` are not run as code
    * E.g. `# This is a comment`

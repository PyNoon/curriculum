### Starting Exercise

* Continue [Week 1's homework](https://pynoon.github.io/curriculum/week_1/slides.html#/independent-workhomework)
* **Show your calculation to a neighbour you didn't come with**:
  * Without explaining your code, can they understand what each line
    achieves?
  * What changes would make it easier to read?
  * Hint: Add comments to explain your calculation
    * Lines starting with `#` are not run as code
    * E.g. `# This is a comment`

### Independent Work/Homework

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">

* **Write a random password generator**
  * Combine random strings and numbers into a password
  * Use variables to store intermediate parts of the password
  * Take parts of strings with indexing and slicing
  * To convert numbers to strings: `str(some_int_var)`
  * To get a random integer:
    * Run once: `from secrets import randbelow`
    * Then use: `my_random_int = randbelow(10)`
  * To get a random character from a string:
    `some_str_var[randbelow(len(some_str_var))]`

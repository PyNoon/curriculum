### Warm-Up Exercise

* Continue Week 1's Exercise (see [pynoon.github.io/schedule](https://pynoon.github.io/schedule))
* **Show your calculation from Week 1's Exercise to a neighbour you didn't come with**:
  * Without explaining your code, can they understand what each line
    achieves?
  * What changes would make it easier to read?
  * Hint: Add comments to explain your calculation
    * Lines starting with `#` are not run as code
    * E.g. `# This is a comment`

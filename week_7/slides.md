### Will programming become obsolete?

<div style="font-size: 0.7em; display: flex; align-items: center;">

* Probably not
* If anything, programming is more important to "glue" AI to
  data/systems
* AI-generated code often needs fixing - **you still need to know how to
  fix it**
* The essence of programming is about *precisely* instructing a
  computer - you still need to carefully **consider** and
  **communicate** those instructions

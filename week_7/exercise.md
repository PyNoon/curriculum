# PyNoon Week 7 - Exercise

## 1. User Interface Practice

* Build your own user interface for some task
* For example:
  * To capture user input for your project
  * To provide a search box or category for filtering the AirBnB
    listings data
  * To call some other AI model, such as a text summarisation model:
    https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn
* Use the pattern from the tutorial of building the user interface as
  a function.
  * Separate out any "business logic" into separate functions that are
    passed as arguments to the form.
  * Add comments and a function docstring to make the purpose of your
    user interface clear.

### Lunch Talk: AI-Assisted Python Programming

* ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc. are quite good at generating Python code
* Will programming become obsolete?
* Do's/Dont's of programming with AI

### Will programming become obsolete?

<div style="font-size: 0.7em; display: flex; align-items: center;">

* Probably not
* If anything, programming is more important to "glue" AI to
  data/systems
* AI-generated code often needs reviewing and fixing - **you still
  need to understand the code you're responsible for**
* The essence of programming is about *precisely* instructing a
  computer - you still need to carefully **consider** and
  **communicate** those instructions

### Do's/Dont's of programming with AI

* **DON'T** feed confidential data into public AI tools
* **DON'T** use generated code you don't understand
* **DON'T** use it to replace reading documentation
* **DO** ask it to explain code (as *one* perspective)
* **DO** use it generate snippets, start projects, and refactor (all
  with review)
* **DO** be specific in your instructions/requirements
* **DO** ask it to try fix code when the result is wrong

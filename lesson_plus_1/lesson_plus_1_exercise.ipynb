    "-   AI will not always generate good results - have a look at the label\n",
    "    assigned to the `When to plant tomatoes` title in the tutorial.\n",
    "-   The classifier we used in the tutorial returns more than just the\n",
    "    best matching label, it also returns a **score** for each label to\n",
    "    give us an indication of the classifier’s confidence in its\n",
    "    classification.\n",
    "-   Modify your code from the tutorial to include the score for each\n",
    "    possible label in columns of `title_df`.\n",
    "    -   **Tip:** You might find it easier to construct `title_details`\n",
    "        using a `for` loop instead of a list comprehension.\n",
    "    -   **Tip:** Consider using Python’s `zip()` function to combine the\n",
    "        lists of labels and scores returned by the classifier.\n",

    "    Processing Unit) to run efficiently - fortunately, Google Colab can\n",
    "    run your code on a computer that has access to a GPU.\n",

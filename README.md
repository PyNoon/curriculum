## Notebook Outputs

You should not commit the outputs of notebook cells to your Git
repository. If you have Python 3 installed, you can use
[nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to configure your
Git repository to exclude the outputs of notebook cells when running
`git add`:

1. `python3 -m pip install nbstripout nbconvert`
2. Run `nbstripout --install` in this directory (installs hooks into
   `.git`).

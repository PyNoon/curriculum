    "## 2. Back-of-the-envelope Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use case for Python programming is performing\n",
    "“back-of-the-envelope” calculations, where need to produce a rough\n",
    "estimate of some numerical value based on a number of input values, some\n",
    "of which may themselves be estimates. For example, we might like to\n",
    "estimate the annual revenue for a company based on known product prices\n",
    "and rough estimates of daily sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is great for performing back-of-the-envelope calculations\n",
    "because:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We can use it to perform many different mathematical operations\n",
    "    -   In the tutorial, you have seen basic operations like `+`, `-`,\n",
    "        `*`, `/` and grouping operation with parentheses `()`.\n",
    "-   The lines of Python code that perform the calculation show how the\n",
    "    calculation is performed step-by-step\n",
    "-   We can add notes and use meaningful variable names so that others\n",
    "    (or our future selves) can easily understand the steps in the\n",
    "    calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to write a Python notebook that performs a\n",

    "    perform your calculation - the inexact inputs are what makes this a\n",
    "    “back-of-the-envelope” calculation.\n",
    "-   Here are a few ideas of possible calculations to inspire you:\n",
    "    -   Calculate the revenue or profit for a business based on some\n",
    "        approximate product prices and counts of customers.\n",
